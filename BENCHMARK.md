## 📋 Corpus

| | |
|---|---|
| 🔬 Quality-scored sessions | **1,885** (30 days, `trends.db`) |
| 📂 Sessions with file reads | **5,814** (backfill corpus for skeleton analysis) |
| 📖 First-reads analyzed | **30,771** |
| 🧪 Benchmark fixtures | **57** across 16 categories |
| ⚡ Avg prompt-cache hit rate | **65.4%** |
| 🖥️ Platforms | Claude Code CLI, VS Code, Codex, OpenClaw, OpenCode |

The two corpora are distinct populations, not double-counted. The backfill corpus is larger because it includes historical sessions recovered from file-read logs.

**Reproducibility:** Your results will differ based on your usage. Every measurement tool ships in the repo so you can regenerate against your own data. See [Running the Benchmarks](#-running-the-benchmarks).

---

## 🏗️ Layer 1: Structural Overhead

> Saves tokens on **every turn of every session.** The single largest compounding savings category.

Before any conversation starts, the model re-sends CLAUDE.md, skills, MCP tool schemas, and MEMORY.md on every turn. Token Optimizer's 8 auditors score each component and flag waste.

| | |
|---|---|
| Unused skills found | 61 |
| Recoverable tokens (skills alone) | 4,026 |
| **Total structural opportunity** | **61,227,039 tokens / $105.36** |

📊 **Tier:** Opportunity (savings if recommendations are applied).

**Why this compounds.** A 5,000-token cleanup saves 5,000 tokens per turn, every session, permanently. In a 50-turn session that is 250,000 fewer tokens. Over a month of sessions it dwarfs every other layer.

**Cache impact on the dollar math:**

| Scenario | Per-turn (5K tokens removed) | 50-turn session |
|---|---|---|
| All fresh ($5/MTok) | $0.025 | $1.25 |
| 65% cached ($0.50 cache / $5 fresh) | $0.011 | $0.53 |

65% is the observed cache-hit average across 1,885 sessions.

## 🔧 Layer 2: Output Compression

> Pattern-matched compression families, not generic summarization. Two mechanisms: **shrink it** or **evict it** (store locally, serve a stub).

### 🧪 Fixture suite: 57 test cases

Every fixture defines raw output, a must-preserve list, a must-not-contain list (catches hallucination), and a minimum compression ratio. A fixture passes only when **all three checks hold.**

| Category | # | What's tested |
|---|---|---|
| git | 7 | status, log, diff, merge conflicts, non-repo error |
| build | 8 | cargo, make, webpack, tsc, gradle |
| lint | 7 | eslint, ruff, clippy, pylint |
| logs | 7 | nginx, docker, systemd, application |
| test runners | 6 | pytest, jest, go test |
| tree / directory | 6 | large listings, nested structures |
| progress | 3 | npm install, pip, downloads |
| 🔒 security | 3 | AWS keys, GitHub PATs, Slack tokens (must NOT be stripped) |
| ⚠️ error passthrough | 5 | non-zero exit, permission denied (must pass through raw) |
| 🔄 tee-on-failure | 5 | failed commands preserve full output |

### 📊 Production events (30 days, 908 measured)

**Compression** (output shrunk, information preserved):

| Feature | Events | Before | After | Ratio | Saved |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Structure map (re-reads) | 228 | 644K | 29K | **91.8%** | 615K |
| Git output | 195 | 410K | 67K | **73.1%** | 343K |
| First-read skeleton | 18 | 189K | 4K | **97.2%** | 185K |
| Loop detection | 50 | 61K | 0.2K | **99.4%** | 61K |
| Directory listings | 47 | 30K | 16K | **28.2%** | 14K |
| Pytest output | 29 | 7K | 0.3K | **91.9%** | 7K |
| Delta reads | 5 | 6K | 0.7K | **75.7%** | 6K |
| Log output | 2 | 0.5K | 0.2K | **57.6%** | 0.3K |
| **Subtotal** | **574** | **1.35M** | **118K** | **91.3%** | **1.23M** |

**Context eviction** (replaced by stub, original stored locally):

| Feature | Events | Tokens removed | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool output archive | 306 | 3,252,146 | ~50-token stub, full result in local SQLite, `expand` to retrieve |
| Checkpoint restore | 12 | 410,503 | Prior session context injected on compaction |
| **Subtotal** | **318** | **3,662,649** | |

> 🟢 **Combined: 908 events, 4,887,138 tokens saved, $17.51 measured (30 days)**

Token counting uses `bytes / 4` as BPE proxy (~15% error vs actual Claude tokenization). Consistent across all measurements.

## 📖 Layer 3: First-Read Skeletons

> Large file, first read, unlikely to edit soon? Serve a skeleton. Full original archived and expandable.

**Corpus replay:** 5,814 sessions, 30,771 first-reads, 2,408 eligible.

| Language | Size | Reads | Sessions | Edit rate | Skeleton ratio | Tokens saved | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| markdown | 16-64KB | 1,329 | 751 | 2.9% | 97.1% | 10.3M | 🟢 PROMOTE |
| python | 16-64KB | 763 | 477 | 1.4% | 96.1% | 6.4M | 🟢 PROMOTE |
| typescript | 16-64KB | 220 | 120 | 0.9% | 97.4% | 1.5M | 🟢 PROMOTE |
| python | 64-256KB | 66 | 64 | 1.5% | 98.5% | 1.5M | 🟢 PROMOTE |
| markdown | 64-256KB | 13 | 9 | 0.0% | 98.9% | 279K | 🟡 hold |
| json | 64-256KB | 3 | 3 | 0.0% | 99.7% | 91K | 🟡 hold |
| typescript | 64-256KB | 2 | 2 | 0.0% | 99.1% | 44K | 🟡 hold |

> **Total projected savings: 20,156,647 tokens**
> 📊 **Tier:** Projected (shadow-mode replay, not yet actively compressing).

**Promotion gate:** edit-within-5-turns rate < 15%, across 20+ reads in 5+ distinct sessions. 🟢 PROMOTE means the gate is met. 🟡 hold means sample size is too small. Token Optimizer proves compression is safe from your own history before enabling it.

**Safety:** Full original always archived before any skeleton is served. Archive fails = full file served unchanged (fail-open). File on disk never modified.

## 🔀 Layer 4: Model Routing

> Compression saves on the response side. Routing saves on the request side.

**30-day production (1,885 sessions):**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Baseline top-tier share | **95%** |
| Current top-tier share | **64.7%** |
| Routable fraction | **30%** of turns |
| 🟢 Realized savings | **$56.95** |
| 💡 Additional potential | **$30.01** |

11 anti-pattern detectors identify turns where a cheaper model produces identical results. Quality nudges prevent degradation before it causes retries.

**Math:** Opus ($5/$25) vs Haiku ($1/$5) = **80% savings** on routable turns. Applies across model ecosystems (Anthropic, Codex, OpenClaw, OpenCode).

---

## 🔄 Layer 5: Session Continuity

> A session that loses context and retries for 10 turns wastes more than any compression saves.

| Mechanism | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Progressive checkpoints** | Captures decisions, errors, file context, agent state to local SQLite throughout a session |
| **Checkpoint restore** | Keyword-matches stored checkpoints on new session or compaction, injects relevant context |
| **Tool result archive** | Replaces large outputs with ~50-token stubs, full result retrievable via `expand` |
| **Loop detection** | Catches repeated reads/retries, breaks the cycle (50 detections, 60,987 tokens saved) |
| **Quality scoring** | 6-signal real-time scoring, fires coaching nudges when quality degrades |

Checkpoint restore and tool archive token counts are reported in Layer 2 (context eviction). Listed here because the mechanism is continuity, but **not double-counted**.

---

## ⚡ Compound Effect

The layers multiply, not add:

```
Session cost = turns x (overhead + avg_output + routing_premium)
              + restart_penalty + retry_waste

Token Optimizer reduces:
  overhead         -> Layer 1 (structural: -15 to -40%)
  avg_output       -> Layer 2+3 (compression + skeletons: -28 to -97%)
  routing_premium  -> Layer 4 (model routing: -40 to -80% on routable turns)
  restart_penalty  -> Layer 5 (checkpoint restore on compaction)
  retry_waste      -> Layer 4+5 (loop detection + quality scoring)
```

**Example: 50-turn Opus session, 15 tool outputs, 1 compaction**

| Layer | Mechanism | Tokens saved | $ saved |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🏗️ Structural | 5K fewer tokens x 50 turns | 250,000 | $1.06 |
| 🔧 Compression | 15 outputs x 10K x 73% ratio | 109,500 | $2.74 |
| 📖 Skeletons | 3 large files x 20K x 97% | 58,200 | $0.29 |
| 📦 Eviction | 4 results archived (avg 10.8K) | 43,200 | $0.15 |
| 🔄 Continuity | 1 compaction, 34K recovered | 34,000 | $0.17 |
| 🛑 Loop prevention | 2 loops x 5 turns x 6.1K | 61,000 | $0.61 |
| **Total** | | **555,900** | **$5.02** |

> At 30 sessions/month: **~$150/month.** The per-layer production data above is the ground truth.

## 📊 Quality Grades (1,885 sessions)

6 signals: stale reads, bloated results, duplicates, compaction depth, decision density, agent efficiency.

| Grade | Sessions | |
|---|---|---|
| **S** | 38 | 🟣 Exceptional: minimal waste, high decision density |
| **A** | 436 | 🟢 Good: clean context, efficient tool use |
| **B** | 528 | 🔵 Normal: some bloat, recoverable |
| **C** | 264 | 🟡 Degraded: significant waste, coaching recommended |
| **D** | 619 | 🔴 Poor: heavy bloat, likely retries or loops |

Tracked over time so you can see whether your habits and Token Optimizer's interventions are improving session efficiency.

## 📝 Methodology Notes

- **Token counting:** `bytes / 4` proxy (~15% error vs actual BPE). Consistent across all measurements.
- **Three-tier accounting:** 📊 Measured (before/after delta), 💡 Opportunity (if recommendations applied), 🔮 Projected (shadow replay). Never summed together; each table labels its tier.
- **Cache honesty:** Prompt-cache savings (cache_read) are never claimed as Token Optimizer savings. The Anthropic cache is free infrastructure. We do account for the secondary benefit: structural cleanup reduces cache-read volume.
- **Security:** Fixtures verify credentials (AWS keys, PATs, Slack tokens) survive compression intact. Compression never strips what the model needs to see.
- **Safety-first promotion:** First-read skeletons require proof from your own session history before activating. No cohort promoted without meeting the edit-rate gate across multiple sessions.
